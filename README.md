# XavierFoxTestRepo

Welcome to **XavierFoxTestRepo** — a multipurpose personal playground for code, thought, and systems.

Originally intended as a chaotic coding sandbox, this repository has grown to include philosophical writing, system ethics drafts, and experimental reflections.  
It is a **living lab** — where functions fail, structures evolve, and ideas take form before they’re ready.

## 📚 What's Inside

- `someTexts/` – Markdown files containing some my personal philosophical fragments.

- Various folders and files for:
  - **C / ANSI C** — strict flag experiments (`-ansi -pedantic -Wall -Werror`)
  - **Python** — quick utilities and logic sketches
  - **Racket** — functional recursion, expression parsing, mindbending purity
  - (More languages/tools to be added as curiosity demands)

## 🧠 Purpose

This repo is not production-ready.  
It is an **interface between syntax and consciousness**, a mixed-media lab for both algorithms and axioms.

Expect:
- Unstable scripts
- Unfinished essays
- Thoughts in progress

## 🛠️ Structure

- Code folders are organized loosely by language or theme
- Text folders (like `someTexts/`) are philosophical by nature, but versioned like code
- No guarantee of logic, but every file is a real-time attempt at system clarity
